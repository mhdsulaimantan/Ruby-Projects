This repository represents most of the solutions for the Odin program Ruby path:
1. **Caesar Cipher**: Implement a caesar cipher that takes in a string and the shift factor and then outputs the modified string.

2. **Sub Strings**: Implement a method #substrings that takes a word as the first argument and then an array of valid substrings (your dictionary) as the second argument. It should return a hash listing each substring (case insensitive) that was found in the original string and how many times it was found.

3. **Stock Picker**: Implement a method #stock_picker that takes in an array of stock prices, one for each hypothetical day. It should return a pair of days representing the best day to buy and the best day to sell. Days start at 0.

4. **Bubble Sort**: Build a method #bubble_sort that takes an array and returns a sorted array. It must use the bubble sort methodology (using #sort would be pretty pointless, wouldnâ€™t it?).
